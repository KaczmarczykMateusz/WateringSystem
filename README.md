Watering System project is made to control entire green plants watering system basing on data from sensors:
- temperature (DS18B20),
- humidity,
- moisture,

- brightness.
It uses data from;
- water flow sensor
in order to dose correct amount of water.

System uses: 
-time settings, 
- moisture of the soil,

it is not decided yet.
